    "# NetCDF scale factors (and add offsets) explained\n",

    "## A little history\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of years ago, waaaaaaay back in 2010, I was managing some output data from a hydrologic model (known as VIC). The 15 year old program had been written before spatial data formats and multidimensional data formats were common and/or invented, so its authors took a fairly na√Øve approach to data management. Simplified, the program took some weather input (temperature, precipitation wind) and calculated a handful of hydrologic output variables (soil moisture, baseflow, runoff). Conceptually, each of the input and output variables is *multidimensional*, typically 3, sometimes 4, and can be thought of as a data cube like the one shown below, but with X, Y and time axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image of a data cube](https://pythonhosted.org/cubes/_images/cube-dims_and_cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "VIC's data management was such that it stored a single series of numbers in one file for *each* point in the product of the X *and* Y dimensions. I.e. one file per \"grid cell\" per variable. Large spatial domains can contain hundreds of grid points in each dimension, (our input data for BC contains 200 * 400 grid cells) so this would mean tens of thousands of input and output files. This becomes untenable and unmanageable very quickly. Consider that we normally have on the order of a dozen or so output variables and we model dozens of scenarios (27 for our CMIP3 work). Hundreds of Xs by hundreds of Ys by tens of variables by tens of scenarios, means millions to 10s of millions of files.\n",

    "n \\text{ emission scenarios } \\times m \\text{ GCMs} \\\\\n",
    "\\times o \\text{ RCMs } \\times p \\text{ downscaling methods} \\\\\n",
    "\\times \\text{ variables } \\times \\text{ space } \\times \\text{ time} \\\\\n",
    "\\\\\n",
    "= \\text{BIG DATA}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the number of files (or *inodes*) on a filesystem is limited to about the range, and our hydrologists quickly found the limit. Having millions of files on your filesystem also slows down any $ O(n) $ algorithms that require a traversal of all files on the system (e.g. nightly backups, `find`, etc.). This had to be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The \"solution\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As I alluded to, there exist specialized data formats that are tailored for this type of regular, multidimensional array data, such that you can pack much of the data into a single file. [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is the primary candidate though there are numerous others that offer similar features.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I wrote a simple, one-off script, to be used once-ish (haha), that packed all of these single grid-cell timeseries into a single NetCDF file. It was simply named `vic2netcdf`. It did what it needed to do and it solved a problem that many people had. Unfortunately, it was commandeered and bastardized by future VIC users without checking some key assumptions: the worst of which was the use of *scale_factors* and *add_offset* attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scale factors and the pack hack\n",
    "\n",
    "Using scale factors and offsets are nothing more than a storage performance hack. If used properly in a numerical domain where your data has a limited range or precision, they *can* save you a lot of space. But if used improperly, at best, they make your data pipeline confusing, and at worst they cause programming errors, data corruption or *loss* of precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why scale factors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly go over some basics of computational storage, to help explain why they *would* be used. Numbers are generally represented in the computer as either integers or \"floating point\" numbers. For both, the range of values that can be represented is a function of the number of bits. For example if we had a 4 bit integer, we could represent $ 2^4 $ different integers over some range (either 0 to 15 for unsigned integers or -7 to +8 for signed integers). The *actual* range of a standard signed 32-bit integer is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Floating point numbers are a bit more complicated, but for the sake of simplicity imagine using scientific notation such as $ 1.5 \\times 10^4 $. The number is described by two parts: the mantissa (1.5) and the exponent (4). Floating point storage is similar but the two terms are in binary instead of decimal (with a few more complications and specifics). In any case, the range and precision that you can describe is a function of how many bits you have. For a 32-bit float, you can represent numbers as small as $ 1.2 \\times 10^{-38} $ and as large as $ 3.4 \\times 10^{38} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever taken a look at a physical, mercury thermometer, you may have noticed that temperature on earth does not get that cold or that hot. Likewise, the maximum amount of annual precipitation on BC is on the order of 7500 millimeters and we don't really need any precision greater than 1 millimeter. So the basic building block containers that we have for storing data, 32-bit integers and 32-bit floating point numbers, contain an enormous amount of wasted space given the precision that we require in this particular domain. There aren't *many* containers that are smaller, but we *do* have 16-bit \"short\" integers that take up half the space and 8-bit \"chars\" that require half of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new problem becomes the fact that our data are not integers, and the range of our data (let's say 0.0 to +7500.0 for precipitation and -100.0 to +100.0 for temperature) does not necessarily overlap or match up with the range of short integers (-32k to +32k-ish).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use scale factors\n",
    "\n",
    "It's actually quite simple to compute a well-packed float into a short int (or even an 8-bit byte) and maximize the represented range. The following is adapted from [Unidata's NetCDF Best Practices](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/BestPractices.html) document.\n",

    "Writing a packing/unpacking function requires three parameters: the max and min of the data, and $ n $, the number of bits into which you wish to pack (8 or 16). In Python:"

    "Packing floating point numbers into smaller data types has the potential to half or quarter the data input or output requirements for an application. It's easy to get the scaling parameters wrong, and most of the ones that we use at PCIC *are* inappropriate. The code to compute the correct parameters is fairly trivial. The down side is that it complicates your code and your processing chain, and you have to make *absolutely sure* that any file I/O checks and uses your scale factor and add offset. Some NetCDF libraries/applications will do this for you and others will not. Make sure that you know which you are using.\n",
